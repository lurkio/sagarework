# sagarework
A rework of the SAGA text adventure engine on the BBC Micro.

There are two bits of the code: the C code to compress the raw Scott Adams files and graphics to the format I use and the 6502 Assembler for the actual engine.

The code was designed to be assembled with Rich Talbot-Watkins's BeebASM (from http://www.retrosoftware.co.uk/wiki/index.php?title=BeebAsm).
